# ML_Titanic_lives_prediction
Model for predicting the lives in Titanic incident

Here I have worked on Titanic dataset for predicting lives or survival. Dataset is directly taken from one of the github repositaries. I used two different alogorithms i.e. Logistic Regression & Decesion Tree Classifier.
I found that the accuracy of Logistic Regression is found to be more than Decesion Tree.
